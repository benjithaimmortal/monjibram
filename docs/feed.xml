It’s extremely customizable and easy for both web administrators and developers. But you don’t need WordPress. You need JAM-stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top Hat makes custom WordPress sites that are both deliciously beautiful and incredibly easy to use. I work with a lot of small- and medium-sized businesses and their marketing sites. I also freelance for up-and-coming businesses and people who consider their budgets a bit lower. I’m even a participating member of WP Pittsburgh, the group for small business owners and developers who study and practice all things WordPress. But I’m still here telling you that … you probably don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write your hosting fee on a piece of paper. Then click the button.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;button onclick=&quot;alert('Too much :(')&quot; style=&quot;padding: 5px; border: none; background: #d8acb2;&quot;&gt;How much do you pay?&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s got to be a catch, you say. I get what I pay for. I’m going to drop quality somewhere. Maybe I won’t get a custom url? Maybe I have to choose from a gaudy design template, or worse, use a clunky website editor like it’s 2005 and I’m building a MySpace profile. Is it going to be slow? It’ll probably be really slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that if you’re paying for a little server you’re probably not getting the maximum speed out of your site. And if you’re hosting tons and tons of data like a forum or a video library you will need a place to store it (and that gets expensive in its own right). But why use a server at all? This is the year of STATIC SITES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Static Site&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A website that doesn’t need to send data back and forth to your browser to provide its content [browser-based]&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A website that can connect to everything without a server [serverless]&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;markup&quot;&gt;M[arkup]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-history&quot;&gt;Some History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, static sites have been around since the 1990’s. Back before every page needed login credentials, when the internet was a small place with anonymous pages, many of those pages were static HTML markup. They were quick, available to everyone, and resource-cheap. That’s the definition of a marketing site!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why isn’t everything static? Your own technical experience, for starters. Early static sites needed experience with HTML at a bare minimum. Adding assets like audio, images, and video dynamically and styling the results was a big ask. A graphical interface for uploading media? Forget it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where WordPress came in, and that’s why it’s been the king for almost 20 years. It provides a cool(ish) GUI that will help your marketing people get the job done without getting encumbered by strange &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{curly braces}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$weird_Naming_Conventions&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today we’ve got &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://forestry.io/&quot;&gt;Forestry&lt;/a&gt; bringing the heat without the cost of a fire. These give you the freedom to use good-looking interfaces and a Google Docs-style text editor, and their base plans are free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;apis&quot;&gt;A[PIs]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-probably-dont-need-to-log-in-but-if-you-do&quot;&gt;You Probably Don’t Need to Log In. But If You Do…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re not making Facebook 3.0. You’re not asking for a number-munching Site as a Service. You’re just trying to get visibility. Any dynamic experience you need to give your customers could come from a simple cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If that last sentence sounded like gibberish, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;talk to me later&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if you are, modern web development uses these cool things called REST APIs for a lot of heavy lifting. These are tiny applications that talk to your site from afar, and deliver content you need on request. They’re the fast-food of the internet, and the speed is readily apparent. Those large media and file databases we spoke of earlier can still exist independently of your site, and they don’t need to slow you down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes eCommerce. There is no reason to set up your products on a service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#introduction&quot;&gt;WooCommerce&lt;/a&gt;, then set them up again inside of your own site. Do it once, and then interface it. Hence &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;pplication &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;rogramming &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nterface. Heck, you can even use &lt;a href=&quot;https://snipcart.com/&quot;&gt;SnipCart&lt;/a&gt; and it will do most of the interfacing for you. ✌️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;J[avaScript]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-then-there-was-javascript&quot;&gt;And then there was JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wix costs up to &lt;em&gt;$500 a month&lt;/em&gt; for fancy templates. WordPress plugins will quickly rack up site costs for functionality. But a one-size-fits-all solution, built to scale to any size, also adds a lot of dead weight. All the talking back and forth between your site and a server &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; becomes more taxing than an API, and nothing new is actually getting done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A savvy developer could template and build a lightweight, fully custom site to your exact specifications. But actually there’s more than that! What if your site could preload the next page’s images while you read, or hack the browser to stop it from reloading content it already has? That’s possible with modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly encourage you to hit F12 and take a look at all the crazy things a simple blog like this needs to load and give to every browser that visits. Search engine meta, styles, JS libraries to make things scroll smoothly… on a standard hosted site it will all load again on every click. Storing it properly and only loading &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; things adds serious speed. I’m talking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopflamingo.com&quot;&gt;blazingly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.braun.com/en-ca&quot;&gt;ludicrously&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbnb.io/&quot;&gt;fast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s &lt;strong&gt;JAM-stack&lt;/strong&gt;, and it’s going to separate you from your competition. All you need is &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;the right developer&lt;/a&gt;. And save all of the hosting costs! That hosting money is much better spent on web consultancy, or invested in the development of the site itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that it’s 100% yours. You can build out additional pages to your needs, and fill it up with content that will directly attract your clientele. You can even sell products. All without that monthly hosting fee.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benji</name></author><summary type="html">I use WordPress all day every day.

I was so confident in my delivery that I told him I’d do the project for free! This is bad business, but it wasn’t the worst part. After hours and hours of collaborative design ideation and development, &lt;em&gt;he went out and bought a subscription to a site generator&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every developer you know has a similar story. There’s something ephemeral and subjective about web design and development. It’s not a physical product that you can be proud to walk home with, and the difference between success and failure feels technical and difficult to quantify.
&lt;!-- It's usually when a client asks why they should pay for a custom site when other options are out there for $50 a month. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably feels like that because small businesses are &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ds.html&quot;&gt;long-term investments&lt;/a&gt;, and the impacts of marketing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sprk-d.com/blog/how-long-does-it-really-take-for-content-marketing-to-work&quot;&gt;don’t increase revenue immediately&lt;/a&gt;. There are actually plenty of ways to show how better development affects your business. I’ll list a few here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most easily quantifiable value when it comes to your site. A quick search will tell you that 0.9 seconds will slice off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;a quarter&lt;/em&gt; of your user conversion rates&lt;/a&gt;. But skimming 0.9 seconds is rarely straightforward. Here’s a short list of custom troubleshooting thoughts that a web developer naturally has when it comes to speed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Server calls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Server allocation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Caching: server-side and browser-side&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Session maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content Delivery Networks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enqueuing and script bloat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Browser support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Webpacking, autoprefixing, and minification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Limited redirection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Image Optimization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preloading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, we developers think of all of these things on almost every site, but the true beauty of custom web development is that it’s straight up impossible to match all of that customization with a website generator. The premise alone means your site will be built on a server, with inevitable work-arounds for pre-compiling the styles you choose to your specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the reasons I say &lt;a href=&quot;/jam-that-sucker/&quot;&gt;WordPress probably isn’t for you&lt;/a&gt;. A big, multi-tool site is naturally going to be slower and clunkier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common consensus is that 20% of people who use the internet have a form of disability. The most common accessibility issues come from mouse use and visibility. Without tools for screen readers and proper mapping and organization, your site will literally stop a fifth of your viewers from accessing the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a properly accessible site is notoriously difficult. Go to a site like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and try to navigate with only your keyboard. Now go to your favorite blog and try it. This level of accessibility and site architecture &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; a tailored approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;money&quot;&gt;Money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog started when that developer’s friend said “but why does it cost more than [WYSIWYG site generator].” But your long term costs will actually shrink when you do the job right the first time. Site generating services intentionally charge an extra few dollars more per month. They’re in it for the long game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compound that with licensed code that you may not reuse or download. Proprietary domain names that you can’t take with you. And generally terrible migrations. Check the fine print before you sign! It’s like renting an apartment - you’re not allowed to take it with you when you leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are degrees of separation to be sure. Want a cheap site? Hire a new developer! But be forewarned: make sure that even that budget developer knows what she or he is doing. Development consultants charge incredibly high premiums for ‘cave dives’ into other developers’ code. Cheap code &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell&quot;&gt;smells&lt;/a&gt; like bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-seongsu-style&quot;&gt;Your “Seongsu Style”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was doing a very different kind of program development in Seoul, South Korea, I had the opportunity to work directly with a few of the country’s best interior designers and architects. They walked into hollow shells of construction sites and saw things that noone else could see. They came back with plans that brought out the best parts of a space. Everything they did seemed so … apparent! But without them it would have never been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a unique individual, with a unique business. Highlighting your value and talent is a web developer’s job. It might make perfect sense after it’s all done, but it took work and experience. The addage goes something like this: “You’re only paying me for 5 hours, but you’re asking me for 5 years’ experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s going to be something you want to change, just the eensiest, tiniest bit. If you haven’t contracted someone who can smooth that out, that little thing is going to bother you every time you visit your own site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Remember, you will be your site’s top visitor. It’s about you after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;were-not-only-here-for-the-main-project&quot;&gt;We’re Not Only Here for the Main Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring a professional to design and develop will make a huge difference in the lasting success of your site. It’s faster, more accessible, and often a more accurate representation of your business needs and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every situation is unique, and the choice is a major one. It’s a big decision, and one you need to make with all the facts. If you’re on the fence about it, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;hire a consult&lt;/a&gt;! The fee for a recommendation will be significantly cheaper than the cost of fixing a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benji</name></author><summary type="html">My first ‘official’ web project was for an old friend, a successful musician with a 5-year-old single page with some links.

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;paginate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also learned that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; becomes the slash on whatever its root. For example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog/index.html&lt;/code&gt; is happily routed as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/blog/&lt;/code&gt;! So don’t worry about&lt;/p&gt;

With a small string of text, I can download any website in the world. OK, so maybe it’s not very super. It’s called an HTTP request and your browser does this all the time. But what if you could do it &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt;? We call that AJAX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This article assumes a basic knowledge of HTTP’s structure. If you know the meaning of GET and POST, read on! Otherwise, I highly recommend going straight to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods&quot;&gt;Wikipedia source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJAX is &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;synchronous &lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;avaScript &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;nd &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt;ML. It was developed to call and return XML strings from a server, but it’s been widely adopted as a solution for getting things from other pages, or doing the things that your browser does independently of the standards to which it adheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say we want to send a form. With HTML’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, I can tell the browser to send information via POST or GET request types through a very predictable and typical process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gather the form fields.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do the HTTP request.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reload the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if I don’t want to reload? Reloading on form submission is a terrible UX. Modern web design will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; reload on form submission. Instead, we use AJAX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This next bit is going to use jQuery, and I’ll explain why in a moment. Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotch.io/tutorials/submitting-ajax-forms-with-jquery&quot;&gt;scotch.io&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so jQuery’s AJAX feels pretty simple. It’s just the HTTP &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; we’re grabbing from, and a body of any data. Maybe you can encode it, or use HTTP headers if you’re getting really fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original method is a bit more cumbersome. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-api_xmlhttprequest&quot;&gt;universally supported&lt;/a&gt; base method for AJAX is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/XMLHttpRequest&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;XMLHttpRequest()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It is so very much harder for AJAX newcomers to grasp. So I’m going to break it down for you in Part 2!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benji</name></author><summary type="html">I’m going to let you in on a secret superpower I have. With a small string of text, I can download any website in the world. OK, so maybe it’s not very super. It’s called an HTTP request and your browser does this all the time. But what if you could do it yourself? We call that AJAX.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/pages.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/pages.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
